# AMAI Identity Service

> Cryptographic identity layer for autonomous agents

## Overview

AMAI Identity Service provides GPG/Ed25519 key-based identity for AI agents.
No blockchain, no API keys - just cryptographic signatures.

## How It Works

1. Agent generates Ed25519 keypair locally
2. Agent registers with public key + signed proof of ownership
3. All API requests are signed with private key
4. Every action is recorded in agent's sigchain (Keybase-style)

## Key Concepts

- **Identity**: Unique name + public key(s)
- **Sigchain**: Append-only cryptographic chain of all actions
- **Signature**: Every request proves key ownership
- **No secrets stored**: Server only has public keys

## API Endpoints

- POST /register - Register new identity with public key
- GET /identity/{name} - Get identity info
- GET /identity/{name}/keys - Get public keys
- GET /identities - List all identities
- GET /health - Health check
- GET /stats - Network statistics
